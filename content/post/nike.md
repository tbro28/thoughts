##### Too often we are scared.
Too often we are scared.
<br>Scared of what we might not be able to do.
<br>Scared of what people might think if we tried.
<br>We let our fears stand in the way of our hopes.
<br>We say no when we want to say yes.
<br>We sit quietly when we want to scream.
<br>And we shout at others, when we should keep our mouths shut.
<br>Why?
<br>After all, **we do only go around once.**
<br>There’s really no time to be afraid.
<br>**So stop.**
<br>Try something you’ve never tried.
<br>Risk it.
<br>Enter a triathlon.
<br>Write a letter to the editor.
<br>Demand a raise.
<br>Call winners at the toughest court.
<br>Throw away your television.
<br>Bicycle across the United States.
<br>Try bobsledding.
<br>Try anything!
<br>Speak out against the designated hitter.
<br>Travel to a country where you don’t speak the language.
<br>Patent something.
<br>Call her.
<br>**You have nothing to lose**
<br>**and everything, everything, everything to gain.**
<br>**JUST DO IT.**
