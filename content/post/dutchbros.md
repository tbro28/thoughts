>To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind;  
to talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet;  
to make all your friends feel there is something in them;  
to look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true;  
to think only the best, to work only for the best and expect only the best;  
to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own;  
to forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future;  
to wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile;  
to give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others;  
and to be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.
