To laugh often and much;
<br>To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
<br>To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
<br>To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others;
<br>To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;
<br>To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
<br>This is to have succeeded.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882) American Essayist & Poet
