#### 6 Rules
<br>
##### 1. Trust yourself
* Dig deep down, who do you really want to be? Not your parents or teachers, but you.

##### 2. Break the rules
  * It is impossible to be a maverick or true original if you don’t break the rules. You have to think outside of the box.

##### 3. Don’t be afraid to fail
  * You can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions.
  * Don’t get paralyzed by failure or you won’t push yourself.
  * Keep pushing because you believe in yourself and your vision.
  * Success will come.

##### 4. Don’t listen to the naysayers
  * You can’t do this, you can’t do that…
  * Embrace it, create a chip on your shoulder, an extra incentive and drive towards your goals.
  * When you do finally break through your actions will have shown that it was possible.

##### 5. Work your butt off
  * Leave no stone unturned.
  * Ali: “I don’t count my pushups, I only start counting when it starts hurting.”
    * Because that’s when it really counts.
    * No pain, no gain.
    * Remember that someone is working hard and getting ahead regardless of what you’re doing.
    * None of these rules work unless you do.

##### 6. Giving back
  * Always find time to give something back.
  * Reaching out and helping people will bring more satisfaction, than anything else that you have ever done.
