When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
<br>When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
<br>When funds are low and the debts are high,
<br>And you want to smile but you have to sigh,
<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,
<br>Rest if you must, but don't you quit.

<br>Life is queer with its twists and turns,
<br>As every one of us sometimes learns,
<br>And many a failure turns about,
<br>When he might have won if he'd stuck it out.
<br>Don't give up, though the pace seems slow -
<br>You may succeed with another blow.

<br>Often the goal is nearer than
<br>It seems to a faint and faltering man;
<br>Often the struggler has given up
<br>When he might have captured the victor's cup,
<br>And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,
<br>How close he was to the golden crown.

<br>Success is failure turned inside out -
<br>The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
<br>And you never can tell how close you are -
<br>It may be near when it seems afar;
<br>So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -
<br>It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.
