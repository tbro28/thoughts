Learning how to think really means
learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It
means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay
attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.

##### The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.
It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to
do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness;
awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all
around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and
over:

<code>
"This is water."
</code>

<code>
"This is water."
</code>

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult
world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand clich√© turns out
to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it
commences: now.
I wish you way more than luck.
