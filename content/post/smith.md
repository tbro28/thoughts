##### Play it with passion.

One life, you die at the end.
We hope for candyland.
But it could be as simple as get in a box and stay there for eternity.
You had your shot, you're a computer, we shut you down and you're finished.  
Regardless of the reality of candyland, if this is our one shot on Earth; it really behooves you to always shoot for your dreams every time.  

##### In a world where youâ€™re going to die, why not?  What do you have to lose?  

Smith's dad was a good straight arrow guy doing the right things and living the normal American middle class life. May have had bigger dreams, but never pursued them. In the end he died screaming though, which changed Smith's mindset. It made him realize that there's no point in not trying to accomplish every dream he has, because the reality hit him that we are all going to die at the end of this journey. Make it a journey. There is really no reason not to try.

 * We know that the end game is death, so why not?
 * As Jobs said "Remembering that you will die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking that you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."
 * Chase it all down; big and small.
 * Go after your dreams.
