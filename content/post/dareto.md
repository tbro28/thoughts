"Imma show you, how great I am.
<br>Last night, I cut the light off in my bedroom and was in bed before the room was dark.
<br>Imma show you, how great I am.
<br>Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalised a brick.
<br>I'm so mean, I make medicine sick.
<br>Imma show you, how great I am.
<br>This kid's gonna be the best kid in the world.
<br>This kid's gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew.
<br>Imma show you, how great I am.
<br>I have wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale, I done handcuffed lightnin', thrown thunder in jail.
<br>Imma show you, how great I am.
<br>All you chumps are gonna bow when I whoop him, all of you.
<br>I know you got him, I know you've got him picked, but the man's in trouble.
<br>Imma show you how great I am.‚Äù
