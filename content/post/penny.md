>“I bargained with Life for a penny,  
And Life would pay no more,  
However I begged at evening  
When I counted my scanty store;  
For Life is just an employer,  
He gives you what you ask,  
But once you have set the wages,  
Why, you must bear the task.  
I worked for a menial's hire,  
Only to learn, dismayed,  
**That any wage I had asked of Life,  
Life would have paid.**”  

― Jessie B. Rittenhouse
