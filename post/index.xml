      <description>6 Rules 
1. Trust yourself  Dig deep down, who do you want to be?  2. Break the rules  It is impossible to be a maverick or true original if you don’t break the rules. You have to think outside of the box.  3. Don’t be afraid to fail  You can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions. Don’t get paralyzed by failure or you won’t push yourself.</description>

      <description> Effort and productivity.  It&amp;rsquo;s not all about effort either.
It&amp;rsquo;s about how you do the activity too.
You can be doing the right activity, but going through the motions.
Productivity is a combination of effort and focusing on doing the activity right.
What are you going to do today?
BUT, more importantly, how are you going to do it?

      <description>We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Imma show you, how great I am. Last night, I cut the light off in my bedroom and was in bed before the room was dark. Imma show you, how great I am. Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalised a brick. I&amp;rsquo;m so mean, I make medicine sick. Imma show you, how great I am. This kid&amp;rsquo;s gonna be the best kid in the world.</description>

      <description>Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.
The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death. It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:</description>

      <description>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, When the road you&amp;rsquo;re trudging seems all uphill, When funds are low and the debts are high, And you want to smile but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must, but don&amp;rsquo;t you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns, As every one of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about, When he might have won if he&amp;rsquo;d stuck it out.</description>

      <description> Well, we like war. We like war. We are a war like people. We like war because we are good at it. You know, why we are good at it, because we get a lot of practice. This country is only 200 years old and already we’ve had 10 major wars. The average a major war every 20 years in this country.

      <description>Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed. “Nothing in particular,” she replied. I might have been incredulous had I not been accustomed to such responses, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.
How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note?</description>

      <description>I never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot. Why? Because when you think about the consequences, you always think of a negative result. Some people get frozen by the fear of failure. They get it from peers or from just thinking about the possibility of negative results. They might be afraid of looking bad or being embarrassed. I realized that if I was going to achieve anything in life I had to be aggressive.</description>

      <description>Too often we are scared. Too often we are scared. Scared of what we might not be able to do. Scared of what people might think if we tried. We let our fears stand in the way of our hopes. We say no when we want to say yes. We sit quietly when we want to scream. And we shout at others, when we should keep our mouths shut. Why?</description>

      <description>To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.</description>

      <description> Winning is not a one time thing. It&amp;rsquo;s an all the time thing. You don&amp;rsquo;t win once in a while and you don&amp;rsquo;t do things right once in while. You do them right all of the time. Winnning is a habit.
Appreciate the grind, the discipline, and to win, and to win, and to win.

      <description>Now there really isn’t anything radically wrong with being sick or with dying. Who said you’re supposed to survive? Who gave you the idea that it’s a gas to go on and on and on?
And we can’t say that it’s a good thing for everything to go on living. In a very simple demonstration that if we enable everybody to go on living, we overcrowd ourselves.
Why else would we have children?</description>

      <description>“You do not know where your decisions come from, they pop up like hiccups. People have a great deal of anxiety about making decisions, ‘Did I think this over long enough? Did I take enough data into consideration?’
And if you think it through you find you never could take enough data into consideration, the data for a decision in any given situation is infinite. So what you do is you go through the motions of thinking about out what you will do about this, but worriers are people who think of all the variables beyond their control, and what might happen!</description>

      <description>What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.
Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering, and I responded&amp;hellip;sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.
Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth? Those who were kindest to you, I bet.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I&amp;rsquo;d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.</description>

      <description>What’s yours? How will you serve the world? What do they need that your talent can provide? That’s all you have to figure out. As someone who has done what you are about to go do, I can tell you from experience, the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is.
That peace that we’re after, lies somewhere beyond personality, beyond the perception of others, beyond invention and disguise, even beyond effort itself.</description>

      <description>To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind;
to talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet;
to make all your friends feel there is something in them;
to look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true;
to think only the best, to work only for the best and expect only the best;
to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own;</description>

      <description>This is the beginning of a new day I have been given this day to use as I will. I can waste it or use it for good. What I do today is important because I am exchanging a day of my life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever. Leaving something in its place I have traded for it. I want it to be a gain, not loss; good, not evil; success, not failure.</description>

      <description>Play it with passion. One life, you die at the end. We hope for candyland. But it could be as simple as get in a box and stay there for eternity. You had your shot, you&amp;rsquo;re a computer, we shut you down and you&amp;rsquo;re finished.
Regardless of the reality of candyland, if this is our one shot on Earth; it really behooves you to shoot for your dreams every time.</description>

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &amp;ldquo;superstar,&amp;rdquo; every &amp;ldquo;supreme leader,&amp;rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there&amp;ndash;on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</description>

1. Connecting the dots  He took a calligraphy class at Reed College. 10 years later it all came back to him and used that knowledge in the Mac. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to connect the dots looking forward. You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  If you simply do enough things and show curiosity with the ability to learn, eventually they&amp;rsquo;ll fit together in some fashion.</description>
