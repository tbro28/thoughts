      <description>Play it with passion. One life, you die at the end. We hope for candyland. But it could be as simple as get in a box and stay there for eternity. You had your shot, you&amp;rsquo;re a computer, we shut you down and you&amp;rsquo;re finished.
Regardless of the reality of candyland, if this is our one shot on Earth; it really behooves you to shoot for your dreams every time.</description>
