      <description>Pale Blue Dot from Richard G on Vimeo.
 -- Look again at that dot. That&amp;rsquo;s here. That&amp;rsquo;s home. That&amp;rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &amp;ldquo;superstar,&amp;rdquo; every &amp;ldquo;supreme leader,&amp;rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there&amp;ndash;on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</description>

      <description>We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</description>

      <description>Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.
The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death. It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:</description>

      <description>To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind;
to talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet;
to make all your friends feel there is something in them;
to look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true;
to think only the best, to work only for the best and expect only the best;
to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own;</description>

      <title>Helen Keller - Three Days to See (1933)</title>

      <description>Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed. “Nothing in particular,” she replied. I might have been incredulous had I not been accustomed to such responses, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.
How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note?</description>

      <description> What is privilege? Did I really have an advantage as a white male in America? It isn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as other places right? So I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry about it I guess.

      <title>Social Media Being Driven by Confirmation Bias</title>

      <description>I knew this years ago when noticing how Facebook was adjusting feeds. People that I didn&amp;rsquo;t view started getting filtered out and the more I looked at a particular topic I started seeing a lot more suggestions around those topics. Very specific suggested posts and articles too; extremely well targeted. I became acutely aware that I was inadvertently being steered down a path by a feed of information. I was personally looking at motivational material and adventure related sports, but it was easy to see that this was being done across the board.</description>

      <description>To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.</description>

      <title>Alan Watts - Acceptance of Death</title>

      <description>Now there really isn’t anything radically wrong with being sick or with dying. Who said you’re supposed to survive? Who gave you the idea that it’s a gas to go on and on and on?
And we can’t say that it’s a good thing for everything to go on living. In a very simple demonstration that if we enable everybody to go on living, we overcrowd ourselves.
Why else would we have children?</description>

      <description>“You do not know where your decisions come from, they pop up like hiccups. People have a great deal of anxiety about making decisions, ‘Did I think this over long enough? Did I take enough data into consideration?’
And if you think it through you find you never could take enough data into consideration, the data for a decision in any given situation is infinite. So what you do is you go through the motions of thinking about out what you will do about this, but worriers are people who think of all the variables beyond their control, and what might happen!</description>
