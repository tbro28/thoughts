      <description>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, When the road you&amp;rsquo;re trudging seems all uphill, When funds are low and the debts are high, And you want to smile but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must, but don&amp;rsquo;t you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns, As every one of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about, When he might have won if he&amp;rsquo;d stuck it out.</description>
