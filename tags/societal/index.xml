      <description>What harm can a snowflake do? Is it part of a light winter snow fall gently floating to the ground that I can play in? Or is it part of an avalanche racing towards me about to bury me?
 &amp;ldquo;For some, the only difference between a classroom and a plantation, is time.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;At the core, none of us were meant to be common. We were born to be commets.</description>

      <title>Social Media Being Driven by Confirmation Bias</title>

      <description>I knew this years ago when noticing how Facebook was adjusting feeds. People that I didn&amp;rsquo;t view started getting filtered out and the more I looked at a particular topic I started seeing a lot more suggestions around those topics. Very specific suggested posts and articles too; extremely well targeted. I became acutely aware that I was inadvertently being steered down a path by a feed of information. I was personally looking at motivational material and adventure related sports, but it was easy to see that this was being done across the board.</description>
