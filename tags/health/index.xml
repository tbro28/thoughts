      <description>â€œWhen I was sixteen, I had just two things on my mind - girls and cars. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good with girls. So I thought about cars. I thought about girls, too, but I had more luck with cars.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that when I turned sixteen, a genie had appeared to me. And that genie said, &amp;lsquo;Warren, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you the car of your choice. It&amp;rsquo;ll be here tomorrow morning with a big bow tied on it.</description>
