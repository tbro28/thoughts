      <description>&amp;ldquo;Imma show you, how great I am. Last night, I cut the light off in my bedroom and was in bed before the room was dark. Imma show you, how great I am. Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalised a brick. I&amp;rsquo;m so mean, I make medicine sick. Imma show you, how great I am. This kid&amp;rsquo;s gonna be the best kid in the world.</description>

      <title>Winning is a habit (Vince Lombardi)</title>

      <description> Winning is not a one time thing. It&amp;rsquo;s an all the time thing. You don&amp;rsquo;t win once in a while and you don&amp;rsquo;t do things right once in while. You do them right all of the time. Winnning is a habit.
Appreciate the grind, the discipline, and to win, and to win, and to win.
