      <title>Bargained with Life for a Penny</title>

      <description>“I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening
When I counted my scanty store;
For Life is just an employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.
I worked for a menial&amp;rsquo;s hire,
Only to learn, dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have paid.</description>

      <description>  Effort and productivity.  It&amp;rsquo;s not all about effort either.
It&amp;rsquo;s about how you do the activity too.
You can be doing the right activity, but going through the motions.
Productivity is a combination of effort and focusing on doing the activity right.
What are you going to do today?
BUT, more importantly, how are you going to do it?

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Imma show you, how great I am. Last night, I cut the light off in my bedroom and was in bed before the room was dark. Imma show you, how great I am. Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalised a brick. I&amp;rsquo;m so mean, I make medicine sick. Imma show you, how great I am. This kid&amp;rsquo;s gonna be the best kid in the world.</description>

      <description> Winning is not a one time thing. It&amp;rsquo;s an all the time thing. You don&amp;rsquo;t win once in a while and you don&amp;rsquo;t do things right once in while. You do them right all of the time. Winnning is a habit.
Appreciate the grind, the discipline, and ;&amp;lsquo;;Tto win, and to win, and to win.
